# Unit Status and Change Type

CMECS units may undergo various types of changes from version to version. Listed below are the unit status and the types of changes that may occur. Each original CMECS unit is assigned a unique Unit Identifier (CMECS_XXXXXXXX). Certain types of changes require issuance of a new Unit ID or a Unit ID deprecation. Units retain their Unit IDs until they are modified in a way that alters the fundamental meaning, or concept, of the unit. When units are deprecated, they are removed from the CMECS classification but remain members of the CMECS Catalog so that they can be referenced by works that have used earlier versions.
