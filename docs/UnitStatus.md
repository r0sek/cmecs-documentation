# Unit Status
- **Original Unit** A unit that has been added to the CMECS Catalog for the first time at any point in the Catalog's life-cycle. All units published in the FGDC-STD-018-2012 document are considered Original Units until they are modified in a way that alters the fundamental meaning, or concept, of the unit. Units that are added to the Catalog in subsequent versions are considered Original Units if they represent new concepts and are not the result of lumping, splitting, or other re-definition of a predecessor unit's concept. 
- **Deprecated Unit** A unit that has been removed from the CMECS classification as a result of a significant change in concept that does not produce a Derived Unit.  Deprecated Units remain in the CMECS Catalog so that they can be referenced by works that have used earlier versions. 
- **Derived Unit** A unit that originates as the result of lumping or splitting existing (predecessor) units, or changing levels up or down, or moving laterally in the hierarchy.
