# Versions and Releases

The CMECS Catalog follows many Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer, [semver.org](https://semver.org/)) recommendations, which provide a clear strategy for managing and publishing the various types of incremental changes made over the Catalog's lifecycle. The CMECS Catalog uses a X.Y.Z number format for its versioning scheme to indicate Major (X), Minor (Y), and Patch (Z) changes as follows:
-  MAJOR versions are assigned for the first published release and for completely-reviewed and updated releases. For example,
    - Version 1.0.0 is the the representation of CMECS as published in the FGDC-STD-018-2012 document
    - Version 2.0.0, when released, will be the version that has undergone the first complete review of all settings, components, and modifiers, including editorial changes and guidance additions. This review is underway but not yet complete. 
    - Version 3.0.0 will be the version that has undergone a second complete review of all settings, components, and modifiers, including editorial changes and guidance additions. This review cycle will not be initiated for several years.
- MINOR versions are assigned for releases that include changes to one or many units, unit additions and deprecations, or changes to the CMECS framework. These changes can be adopted and released at any time and do not have to conform to any specific cycle, but efforts will be made to compile incremental changes into as few releases as possible. For example,
    - 1.1.0 will be the release that includes changes to Substrate Component units and hierarchy, unit additions, unit deprecations, and added annotations.
    - 1.2.0 will be the release that includes changes to Biotic Component units and hierarchy, unit additions, unit deprecations, and added annotations.
    - 1.3.0 will be the release that includes changes to Geoform Component units and hierarchy, unit additions, unit deprecations, and added annotations.
- PATCH versions are assigned for releases that include editorial corrections, new or revised guidance or other annotation information but DO NOT include changes to units or hierarchy. For example,
     - 2.0.1 would be assigned to a release that includes only editorial corrections or new annotations, etc.
