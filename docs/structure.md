# About CMECS
The Coastal and Marine Classification Standard (CMECS, FGDC-STD-018-2012) is collection of defined terms (“units”) used to describe and classify marine ecological data. It is a national scheme for classifying and integrating observational data collected in coastal, marine, and lacustrine environments in U.S. waters. CMECS was endorsed by the U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) in 2012. The CMECS framework arranges its units hierarchically or semi-hierarchically within domain-specific modules: the Biotic, Geoform, Substrate, and Water Column Components; and Aquatic and Biogeographic Settings. This framework emulates the spatial nesting concepts used in GIS software so that the CMECS units can be used to categorize and map observational data to model ecosystems.
